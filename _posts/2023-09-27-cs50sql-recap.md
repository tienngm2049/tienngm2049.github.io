# Week 0: Querying
## 0.1. Database
**Dabatase** is a way of organizing data such that we can perform four operations on it:
- create
- read
- update
- delete

**Database management systems (DBMS)** provide a way to interact with databases, and users can choose to interact with them through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI). The choice between GUI and CMD often depends on user preference, the complexity of the task, and the specific features offered by the DBMS.

Some well-known DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft Access, MongoDB, etc.

## 0.2. SQL
**SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, and it is widely used to interact with relational databases. Each Database Management System (DBMS) has its own implementation of SQL, which may lead to some differences in syntax and features. 

It's also worth noting that not all databases use SQL. As you mentioned, MongoDB is an example of a NoSQL database, and it doesn't use SQL for queries. NoSQL databases typically offer a more flexible and scalable approach to data storage compared to traditional relational databases.

## 0.3. CLI syntax 

Here's a table summarizing the basic command-line interface (CLI) syntax for PostgreSQL and MySQL:

| Operation                           | PostgreSQL                                     | MySQL                                   |

## 0.4. Some Notes
`LIKE`
- `LIKE` is combined with the operators `%` (matches any characters around a given string) and `_` (matches a single character).
- Comparison of strings with `LIKE` is by default case-insensitive, whereas comparison of strings with `=`is case-sensitive. 

Operators
- The operators that can be used to specify conditions in SQL are `=` (“equal to”), `!=` (“not equal to”) and `<>` (also “not equal to”).


# Week 1: Relating

## 1.1. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An ERD is a visual representation of the relationships among entities in a database. It uses entities, attributes, and relationships to depict the logical structure of a database. The main components include:
- **Entities:** Represent objects or concepts (e.g., customers, orders).
- **Attributes:** Characteristics or properties of entities.
- **Relationships:** Connections between entities.

There are 3 types of relationship: one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between tables in a database. Example below:

![Longlist DB](/images/cs50sql/longlistdb.png)

Each table is an entity in our database. The relationships between the tables, or entities, are represented by the verbs that mark the lines connecting entities.

![Relationship](/images/cs50sql/relationship.png)

Each line in the diagram is in crow's foot notation:
- The first line with a circle looks like a 0 marked on the line. This line indicates that there are no relations.
- The second line with a perpendicular line looks like a 1 marked on the line. An entity with this arrow has to have at least one row that relates to it in the other table.
- The third line, which looks like a crow’s foot, has many branches. This line means that the entity is related to many rows from another table.

## 1.2. Keys 
There are two types of keys: Primiary Key and Foreign Key

**Primary Key**

A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and distinguishes it from every other record in the table. By default, a primary key also implies that the attribute must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values. Common examples of primary keys include employee IDs, product codes, or any other attribute that uniquely identifies each record.


**Foreign Key**

A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the data in two tables, creating a relationship. The table containing the foreign key is called the referencing or child table, and the table containing the primary key being referred to is called the referenced or parent table.

**Create Keys**

We can create Primary Key and Foreign Key, at the table creation step and by altering an existing table:

- At Table Creation:

```sql
-- Creating Table1 with a Primary Key
CREATE TABLE Table1 (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(255),
    -- Other columns...
);

-- Creating Table2 with a Foreign Key referencing Table1
CREATE TABLE Table2 (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(255),
    StudentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Table1(StudentID)
);

```

-  Alter Existing Table:

```sql
-- Adding a Primary Key to an Existing Table
ALTER TABLE Table1
ADD PRIMARY KEY (StudentID);

-- Adding a Foreign Key to an Existing Table
ALTER TABLE Table2
ADD FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Table1(StudentID);

```

 **🗒️Note:** In most relational database management systems (RDBMS), you cannot alter both the foreign key (FK) and primary key (PK) in a single query. You typically need separate statements to alter the primary key and foreign key constraints.

## 1.3. ERD, Snowflake, and Star Schema:
- **ERD and Schema Design:** ERDs are often used in the initial stages of database design to conceptualize and plan the relationships between entities. Snowflake and Star Schemas are implementations of these concepts in a physical database structure.

- **Normalization:** Both Snowflake and Star Schemas involve a form of normalization. The Snowflake Schema takes normalization further by breaking down dimensions into more tables.

- **Data Warehousing:** Snowflake and Star Schemas are commonly associated with data warehousing, where they provide efficient structures for handling large amounts of data. ERDs, on the other hand, help in understanding the logical relationships regardless of the physical implementation.

## 1.4. Subquery
Subqueries in SQL can be placed in different parts of a query, such as the WHERE clause, SELECT clause, and FROM clause. The placement of the subquery depends on the specific requirement and the role the subquery plays in the overall query.

```sql
SELECT "name"
FROM "authors"
WHERE "id" = (
    SELECT "author_id"
    FROM "authored"
    WHERE "book_id" = (
      SELECT "id"
      FROM "books"
      WHERE "title" = 'Flights'
    )
);
```

## 1.5. Sets
- INTERSECT 
  ```sql 
  SELECT "name" FROM "translators"
  INTERSECT
  SELECT "name" FROM "authors";
  ```
- UNION
  ```sql
  SELECT 'author' AS "profession", "name" 
  FROM "authors"
  UNION
  SELECT 'translator' AS "profession", "name" 
  FROM "translators";
  ```
- EXCEPT
  ```sql
  SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
  EXCEPT
  SELECT "name" FROM "translators";
  ```

# Week 2: Designing
## 2.1. Design a Database Schema

- Normalization:
  - First Normal Form (1NF):
    - Ensure atomic values in each column.
    - No repeating groups or arrays.
  - Second Normal Form (2NF):
    - Meet 1NF requirements.
    - No partial dependencies on the primary key.
    - Split tables if needed.
  - Third Normal Form (3NF):
    - Meet 2NF requirements.
    - No transitive dependencies.
- Relationship:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many
- Constraints:
  - PK 
  - FK 
  - Unique 
  - Check 
  - Not Null
  - Auto-Increment
  - Enum
  - Default
- Data Types: MySQL and PostgreSQL are both popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), and while they share many similarities, there are some differences in the data types they support. 

Here's a comparison of common data types between MySQL and PostgreSQL:

Numeric Types:

| MySQL          | PostgreSQL                |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| INT            | INTEGER                   |
| TINYINT        | SMALLINT                  |
| SMALLINT       | SMALLINT                  |
| MEDIUMINT      | INTEGER or BIGINT         |
| BIGINT         | BIGINT                    |
| DECIMAL        | DECIMAL or NUMERIC        |
| FLOAT          | REAL                      |

| LONGTEXT       | TEXT                      |

Date and Time Types:

| MySQL          | PostgreSQL                |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| DATE           | DATE                      |
| TIME           | TIME                      |

| TIMESTAMP      | TIMESTAMP                 |
| YEAR           | YEAR                      |
| INTERVAL       | INTERVAL                  |

Binary Types:

| MySQL          | PostgreSQL                |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| BINARY         | BYTEA                     |
| VARBINARY      | BYTEA                     |
| BLOB           | BYTEA or BLOB             |

## 2.2. Create Table

`CREATE TABLE`

Example of createing table having column constraints

```sql
CREATE TABLE "cards" (
    "id" INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "id" INTEGER,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    "line" TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "swipes" (
    "id" INTEGER,
    "card_id" INTEGER,
    "station_id" INTEGER,
    "type" TEXT NOT NULL CHECK("type" IN ('enter', 'exit', 'deposit')),
    "datetime" NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "amount" NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK("amount" != 0),
    PRIMARY KEY("id"),
    FOREIGN KEY("station_id") REFERENCES "stations"("id"),
    FOREIGN KEY("card_id") REFERENCES "cards"("id")
);
```

`DROP TABLE`

```sql
DROP TABLE "riders";
```

`ALTER TABLE`

```sql
ALTER TABLE "visits"
RENAME TO "swipes";

ALTER TABLE "swipes"
ADD COLUMN "swipetype" TEXT;

ALTER TABLE "swipes"
RENAME COLUMN "swipetype" TO "type";

ALTER TABLE "swipes"
DROP COLUMN "type";
```

# Week 3: Writing

## 3.1. `INSERT INTO`
Syntax:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```
Example:
```sql
-- Insert one row
INSERT INTO "collections" ("id", "title", "accession_number", "acquired")
VALUES (1, 'Profusion of flowers', '56.257', '1956-04-12');

-- Insert multirow
INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired") 
VALUES 
('Imaginative landscape', '56.496', NULL),
('Peonies and butterfly', '06.1899', '1906-01-01');

-- Insert from other table
INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired") 
SELECT "title", "accession_number", "acquired" FROM "temp";
```

To import a file to a table in PostgreSQL, first we need to ceate a temporary table:
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    -- Add other columns as needed
);
```
Then use `\COPY` meta-command in psql
```sql
COPY your_table FROM '/path/to/your_file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

## 3.2. `DELETE`
Syntax:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
Example:
```sql
-- Delete data based on specific condition using WHERE
DELETE FROM "collections"
WHERE "title" = 'Spring outing';

DELETE FROM "collections"
WHERE "acquired" IS NULL;

DELETE FROM "collections"
WHERE "acquired" < '1909-01-01';

DELETE FROM "artists"
WHERE "name" = 'Unidentified artist';

-- More complex deletion
DELETE FROM "created"
WHERE "artist_id" = (
    SELECT "id"
    FROM "artists"
    WHERE "name" = 'Unidentified artist'
);
```

In another possibility, we can specify the action to be taken when an ID referenced by a foreign key is deleted. To do this, we use the keyword `ON DELETE` followed by the action to be taken.
- `ON DELETE RESTRICT`: This restricts us from deleting IDs when the foreign key constraint is violated.
- `ON DELETE NO ACTION`: This allows the deletion of IDs that are referenced by a foreign key and nothing happens.
- `ON DELETE SET NULL`: This allows the deletion of IDs that are referenced by a foreign key and sets the foreign key references to NULL.
- `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`: This does the same as the previous, but allows us to set a default value instead of NULL.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: This allows the deletion of IDs that are referenced by a foreign key and also proceeds to cascadingly delete the referencing foreign key rows. For example, if we used this to delete an artist ID, all the artist’s affiliations with the artwork would also be deleted from the created table.

```sql
FOREIGN KEY("artist_id") REFERENCES "artists"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
FOREIGN KEY("collection_id") REFERENCES "collections"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
```

## 3.3. `UPDATING`

Syntax: 
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
Example:
```sql
UPDATE "created"
SET "artist_id" = (
    SELECT "id"
    FROM "artists"
    WHERE "name" = 'Li Yin'
)
WHERE "collection_id" = (
    SELECT "id"
    FROM "collections"
    WHERE "title" = 'Farmers working at dawn'
);
```
# Week 4: Viewing
## 4.1. CREATE VIEW
The problem is if we want to see the whole data which needs to JOIN 3 tables. but we cannot do it again and again. So the solutiion is view. A view is a virtual table defined by a query.

Say we wrote a query to join three tables, as in the previous example, and then select the relevant columns. The new table created by this query can be saved as a view, to be further queried later on.

Views are useful for:
- simplifying: putting together data from different tables to be queried more simply,
- aggregating: running aggregate functions, like finding the sum, and storing the results,
- partitioning: dividing data into logical pieces,
- securing: hiding columns that should be kept secure.

For example, we need to find books written by Fernanda Melchor
```sql 
SELECT "title" FROM "books"
WHERE "id" IN (
    SELECT "book_id" FROM "authored"
    WHERE "author_id" = (
        SELECT "id" FROM "authors"
        WHERE "name" = 'Fernanda Melchor'
    )
);
```
But the query is too long, we can do it by combining table together to create a view and query from the view:
```sql
-- We just need to add CREATE VIEW on top of the query
CREATE VIEW "longlist" AS
SELECT "name", "title" FROM "authors"
JOIN "authored" ON "authors"."id" = "authored"."author_id"
JOIN "books" ON "books"."id" = "authored"."book_id";

-- Simplify the query needed to find the books written by Fernanda Melchor.
SELECT "title" FROM "longlist" WHERE "name" = 'Fernanda Melchor';
```

We can CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW which will not stored in the database:
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW "average_ratings_by_year" AS
SELECT "year", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "rating" FROM "average_book_ratings" 
GROUP BY "year";
```
We can delete a view by `DROP VIEW "average_book_ratings";`

## 4.2. CTE
A regular view exists forever in our database schema. A temporary view exists for the duration of our connection with the database. A CTE is a view that exists for a single query alone.

```sql
WITH "average_book_ratings" AS (
    SELECT "book_id", "title", "year", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "rating" FROM "ratings"
    JOIN "books" ON "ratings"."book_id" = "books"."id"
    GROUP BY "book_id"
)
SELECT "year" ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "rating" FROM "average_book_ratings"
GROUP BY "year";
```
## 4.3. Securing data
View can be used to enhance database security by limiting access to certain data. 
```sql
-- Using 'Anonymous' to hide the 4th column so other cannot see it.
CREATE VIEW "analysis" AS
SELECT "id", "origin", "destination", 'Anonymous' AS "rider" 
FROM "rides";
```

We can use soft deletion to secure data as well. Soft deletion involves marking a row as deleted instead of removing it from the table. 
```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table
ADD COLUMN is_deleted INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```
## 4.4. CREATE TRIGGER

```sql
-- soft deletion
CREATE TRIGGER "delete"
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE "collections" SET "deleted" = 1 
    WHERE "id" = OLD."id";
END;

-- insert into a view a row that already exists in the underlying table, but was soft deleted
CREATE TRIGGER "insert_when_exists"
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW

# Week 5: Optimizing
## 5.1. CREATE INDEX
Creating an index in a database is a way to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. Indexes allow the database engine to locate and access the rows more quickly, especially when searching or sorting based on specific columns. Here's the basic syntax for creating an index in PostgreSQL:
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```
## 5.2. Types of Indexes
- **Single Column Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column);
  ```

- **Composite Index (Multiple Columns):**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column1, column2);
  ```

- **Unique Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column);
  ```

- **Partial Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column)
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Expression Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (LOWER(column));
  ```

`COVERING INDEX` is when it's no need to go from index to table for result. The answer of the query is already in the index itself.

## 5.3. Explain query
In PostgreSQL, the `EXPLAIN` statement is used to obtain a query execution plan. The EXPLAIN statement provides insights into how the PostgreSQL query planner intends to execute a particular query. This information can be crucial for optimizing queries and understanding the performance characteristics of your SQL statements.

`EXPLAIN your_query;` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE your_query;`

We can use this to understand query to help `CREATE INDEX` more exactly.

## 5.4. VACUUM

PostgreSQL uses a process called VACUUM to reclaim storage occupied by dead rows. PostgreSQL has an autovacuum process that automatically performs VACUUM operations in the background. Ensure that autovacuum is enabled and properly configured in your PostgreSQL settings but if you turn that down you can use VACUUM manually:
```sql
ANALYZE your_table; -- optional
VACUUM your_table;
```
`VACUUM FULL`
`VACUUM FULL` reclaims more space than a regular `VACUUM` but comes with some caveats. It requires an exclusive lock on the table, which means it can block other transactions.
```sql
VACUUM FULL your_table;
```

## 5.5. TRANSACTION
**Concurrency**

Concurrency is the simultaneous handling of multiple queries or interactions by the database. Imagine a database for a website, or a financial service, that gets a lot of traffic at the same time. Concurrency is particularly important in these cases.


**Transactions**

Transactions in a database represent a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. The primary goal of transactions is to ensure the consistency and integrity of the database. Transactions provide the ACID properties:
- **atomicity:** can’t be broken down into smaller pieces,
- **consistency:** should not violate a database constraint,
- **isolation:** if multiple users access a database, their transactions cannot interfere with each other,
- **durability:** in case of any failure within the database, all data changed by transactions will remain

```sql
-- BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT syntax make sure two updates are done simultaneously
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE "accounts" SET "balance" = "balance" + 10 WHERE "id" = 2;
UPDATE "accounts" SET "balance" = "balance" - 10 WHERE "id" = 1;
COMMIT;

-- If UPDATE violates constraints and makes error, use ROLLBACK to reverse;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE "accounts" SET "balance" = "balance" + 10 WHERE "id" = 2;
UPDATE "accounts" SET "balance" = "balance" - 10 WHERE "id" = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```

**Race Conditions**

Race conditions occur in a system when the behavior depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads are scheduled to run. In the context of databases and transactions, race conditions can lead to unexpected and undesirable outcomes. 

- UNLOCKED: this is the default state when no user is accessing the database,
- SHARED: when a transaction is reading data from the database, it obtains shared lock that allows other transactions to read simultaneously from the database,
- EXCLUSIVE: if a transaction needs to write or update data, it obtains an exclusive lock on the database that does not allow other transactions to occur at the same time (not even a read)

```sql
BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION;
```


# Week 6: Scaling


## 6.2. CREATE PROCEDURE
A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements or procedural statements that is stored and can be reused. It is a type of database object in a relational database management system (RDBMS) that allows you to group and organize a set of SQL statements into a single unit of work.

For example we have a collection of art database. Inside the database is a table named "collections" which stores the art collections which both have been sold and not (with soft deletion of 0 and 1)

We can create a view "current_collections" to put the arts which is still in the museum.
```sql
CREATE VIEW "current_collections" AS 
SELECT "title" FROM "collections"
WHERE "deleted" = 0;
```

Now, we will not use view but a stored procedure
```sql
-- Set up stored procedure similar to VIEW above
DELIMITER // -- Change delimiter to //
CREATE PROCEDURE  "current_collection" ()
BEGIN 
    SELECT "title", "accession_number", "acquired"
    FROM "collections" 
    WHERE "deleted" = 0;
END//
DELIMITER ; -- Change delimiter back to ;

-- Call the procedure
CALL "current_collection"; 
```

We can also give stored procedure some parameters
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE "sell" (IN "sold_id" INT)
BEGIN
    -- When input an id, deleted change to 1 at collections table
    UPDATE "collections" SET "deleted" = 1
    WHERE "id" = "sold_id";

    -- Then in transactions table, a transaction is added to a new row 
    INSERT INTO "transactions" ("title" , "action")
    VALUES ((SELECT "title" FROM "collections" WHERE "id" = "sold_id"), "sold");
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Sell the picture having id = 4
CALL "sell"(4);
```

## 6.2. Replication
Replication is a technique used in database management to improve the availability, fault tolerance, and performance of a system. It involves creating and maintaining copies of the same database on multiple servers. There are two primary types of widening database: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Replication can involve horizontal scaling (adding more servers) or creating redundant copies of data on the same or different servers.

- Vertical Scaling
  - Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, involves increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage.
  - This approach is often limited by the hardware constraints of a single machine and might not be cost-effective for handling large-scale data.
- Horizontal Scaling
  - Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves distributing the data and workload across multiple servers.
  - Each server in a horizontally scaled architecture is capable of handling a portion of the overall system load, providing better scalability.
  - This approach is more suitable for handling larger datasets and increasing performance.
- There are different types of database replication, such as master-slave replication and multi-master replication.
  - Master-Slave Replication (Single Leader):
    - In master-slave replication, one database server (master) is designated as the primary source of data, and the changes made to this master are replicated to one or more slave servers.
    - Slaves are used for read operations, offloading the read traffic from the master.
  - Multi-Master Replication (Multi Leader): 
    - In multi-master replication, multiple database servers can accept write operations. Changes made on one server are replicated to all other servers in the network. 
    - This approach provides better write scalability but introduces challenges in handling conflicts.

**Read Replica**

A Read Replica is a copy of a database that is designated for read-only operations. In systems with a master-slave replication setup, read replicas can be used to offload read queries from the primary (master) database. This helps distribute the read traffic across multiple servers, improving overall read performance. Read replicas are kept in sync with the master through the replication process, ensuring that the data on the replicas is up-to-date. They play a crucial role in enhancing scalability and handling increased read loads.


**Sharding**

Sharding is a database scaling technique that involves breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard is a separate database that stores a subset of the overall data. Sharding is typically employed in horizontally scaled architectures. Each shard is distributed across different servers, allowing the system to handle a larger volume of data and transactions.

## 6.3. Access Control:

Creating a New User
```sql
CREATE USER newuser WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
```

This SQL statement creates a new user named "newuser" with the specified password.

Granting Privileges
```sql
GRANT privilege_name [, ...] ON object_name TO user_name [, ...];
```

This SQL statement grants specific privileges (such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.) on a database object (table, sequence, etc.) to a user or a role.

Revoking Privileges
```sql
REVOKE privilege_name [, ...] ON object_name FROM user_name [, ...];
```

This SQL statement revokes specific privileges from a user or a role on a database object.

## 6.4. SQL Injection Attacks:

SQL injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code. To prevent SQL injection:

- **Use Parameterized Queries:**
  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.

- **Validate and Sanitize Input:**
  Validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code.

- **Implement Access Controls:**
  Proper access controls help limit the impact of potential SQL injection attacks by restricting the privileges of database users.

## 6.5. PREPARE ... FROM:

```sql
PREPARE statement_name FROM SQL_string;
```

The `PREPARE` statement in SQL is used to prepare a SQL statement for execution. It takes a SQL string and assigns it to a statement name, making it easier to execute the same SQL statement multiple times with different parameter values.

- `statement_name`: The name given to the prepared statement.
- `SQL_string`: The SQL statement to be prepared.

After preparing the statement, you can execute it using the `EXECUTE` statement with the specified statement name.

**Example:**
```sql
PREPARE my_statement FROM 'SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE column_name = $1';
EXECUTE my_statement USING 'parameter_value';
```

This helps improve performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan for the statement. It can also prevent SQL injection if used properly. The `USING` clause is used to provide parameter values safely.
