description:  This is where I recap my learning in CS50SQL
---

CS50SQL includes a total of 7 modules splitting into 7 weeks:
- Querying
- Relating
- Designing
- Writing
- Viewing
- Optimizing
- Scaling
  
### Querying
In the week 0 of the course, I learnt about some basic querying statements which I have already known from my previous learning on HackerRank other sites such as
`SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE... LIMIT`
But one interesting thing about this course is for the first time I had chance to working with SQL in the terminal and learn about other syntax working with SQLite as well

### Relating
I learnt about Entity Relationship Diagrams, one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between tables in a database.
