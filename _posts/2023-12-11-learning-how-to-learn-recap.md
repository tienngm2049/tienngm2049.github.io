<p>I completed this class in July as part of a pilot experiment to see if I was up to doing the entire program. The course is brilliant, Prof. Walter Lewin does an amazing job bringing physics to life without sacrificing intellectual rigor. Note: This course was removed by MIT, you can access a <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-fall-2003/">different version here</a>. <span class="wpcmsdev-highlight color-yellow">Scott’s rating: 5/5</span></p>
